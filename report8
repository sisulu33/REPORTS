\textbf{Workshop Title:} 3D Printing

\textbf{Student Name:} Sisulu Amanya

\textbf{Student ID:} M24B23/006 

\newpage
\subsection{Executive Summary}

This week's workshop focused on the theoretical aspects of 3D printing, covering the fundamental principles, design processes, and software tools used in 3D modeling. The main learning objectives included understanding the history and evolution of 3D printing, exploring the various design methodS, and gaining skill in 3D modeling software. By the end of the week, I had developed a solid grasp of Computer-Aided Design, file formats for 3D printing, and the impact of 3D printing across different industries.
