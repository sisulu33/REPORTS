\subsection{2. Executive Summary}

This week in recess, we began learning about network administration, focusing on setting up virtualized environments for server management. We were required to download and install Oracle VirtualBox on our PCs and subsequently install Ubuntu Live Server. Additionally, we engaged in outreach programs at Bishop Cipriano Kyangire Secondary School and Seeta Secondary School, where we performed preventive maintenance on their computer labs by cleaning and servicing their PCs. These activities provided both hands-on technical experience and an opportunity to contribute to community development.

\newpage
\subsection{3. Objectives of the Week}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objective 1:} Understand and practice setting up a virtualized server environment.
    \item \textbf{Objective 2:} Gain experience installing and configuring Ubuntu Live Server.
    \item \textbf{Objective 3:} Perform preventive maintenance on computer systems in school labs to get a more hands on experience.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Tools/Resources Used:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Oracle VirtualBox
    \item Ubuntu Live Server ISO
    \item Internet for downloading required files
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Challenges Encountered:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Slow download speeds affected installation time.
    \item Configuration errors due to incorrect resource allocation.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Learning Insights:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Learned the importance of correct system specifications when setting up virtual machines.
    \item Gained practical experience in installing and configuring a server operating system.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Activity 2: Preventive Maintenance at Bishop Cipriano Kyangire and Seeta Secondary Schools}}

\textbf{Description:}

We visited two schools to perform preventive maintenance in their computer labs. This involved cleaning dust from internal components, checking for faulty peripherals, and ensuring proper cable management to prevent hardware failures.
