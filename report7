\textbf{Workshop Title:} System Administration and Virtualization

\textbf{Student Name:} Sisulu Amanya

\textbf{Student ID:} M24B23/006

\subsubsection{\textbf{2. Executive Summary}}

In Week Ten, we focused on system administration, specifically the installation and configuration of Proxmox as a virtual environment. Proxmox is an open-source server virtualization platform used to manage virtual machines  efficiently. During this session, we installed Proxmox and used it to create a virtual machine  using the FreePBX ISO image, an open-source communication server based on Asterisk. After successfully setting up the system, we connected and configured two Cisco landline phones to enable communication between them. This report outlines the installation process, the role of Proxmox in virtualization, the functionality of FreePBX software, and a detailed step-by-step guide on how we configured the system.

\subsubsection{\textbf{6. Reflections}}

This week's activities provided an in-depth understanding of system administration and virtualization. The most challenging aspect was configuring the SIP trunks and ensuring smooth communication between Cisco landline phones. However, overcoming these challenges enhanced my troubleshooting skills. This experience contributes to my overall goal of mastering IT infrastructure management, and I look forward to exploring more advanced networking topics.
