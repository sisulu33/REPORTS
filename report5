\subsection{\textbf{2. Executive Summary}}

This week, during the recess term workshop, we focused on understanding different types of printers, their components, troubleshooting techniques, preventive maintenance, and network setup. The training covered both theoretical and practical aspects, ensuring a hands-on experience in handling printer-related issues. We explored inkjet, laser, dot matrix, and thermal printers, delving into their internal parts and functions. The sessions included diagnosing common printer problems, applying preventive maintenance techniques, and successfully configuring printers on a network. By the end of the week, we had developed essential skills in printer setup and maintenance, which are critical for ICT support roles.

\subsection{\textbf{6. Reflections}}

This week's workshop provided valuable insights into printer maintenance and networking. The most interesting aspect was learning how different printer mechanisms work and the process of setting up printers on a network. Troubleshooting proved to be a challenge, especially when dealing with software-related issues, but it was rewarding to find solutions through systematic diagnostics. This experience contributed significantly to my overall understanding of ICT hardware and network administration. Future sessions could include more complex troubleshooting scenarios and exposure to enterprise-level printer management.
