\textbf{Workshop Title:} Cybersecurity Fundamentals and Ethical Hacking

\textbf{Student Name:} Sisulu Amanya

\textbf{Student ID:} M24B23/006

\textbf{Submission Date:} 18/3/2025

Executive Summary

This week, during our recess term, we engaged in an intensive cybersecurity workshop aimed at building foundational knowledge in ethical hacking, security testing, and penetration testing methodologies. The primary activities revolved around setting up a controlled environment using Oracle VirtualBox, installing Windows, Kali Linux, Metasploitable, and an Android virtual machine. These environments served as a foundation for ethical hacking and security testing.

We explored various cybersecurity concepts, including exploiting vulnerabilities in Windows, privilege escalation techniques, traffic analysis using Wireshark, and Wi-Fi hacking with Aircrack-ng. We also performed vulnerability assessments using Nmap and Nessus and were introduced to SIEM tooling with Wazuh. Through these activities, we gained hands-on experience in practical cybersecurity tactics essential for penetration testing and network security.

\newpage

Reflections

This week was an eye-opening experience into the world of ethical hacking and cybersecurity. The most interesting part was learning how to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows and analyze network traffic. One of the biggest challenges was configuring virtual machines and troubleshooting installation issues, but it provided valuable lessons in system administration. The workshop contributed significantly to my understanding of penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. In future sessions, I would like to explore more real-world cybersecurity attack scenarios and deepen my knowledge of advanced penetration testing techniques.

\newpage
Action Plan for Next Week

\textbf{Review Materials:} Metasploit documentation, Wireshark filtering techniques, Nmap scripting.

\textbf{Skill Development:} Advanced privilege escalation methods, deeper SIEM integration.

\textbf{Preparatory Tasks:} Set up additional virtual machines for advanced testing, explore more wireless security techniques.
